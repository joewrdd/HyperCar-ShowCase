Hi there! I'm Joe Ward, 

 My idea is to develop a desktop application called "HyperCar Showcase" designed for hypercar enthusiasts. The application will allow users to browse, compare, and manage information about hypercars, including technical specifications, performance metrics, pricing, and user reviews. Users will also be able to create a personalized list of favorite hypercars, read and write reviews, and find service centers associated with different manufacturers. This app is expected to be a user-friendly platform where users can view and compare hypercars, filter them by brand, speed, and price, manage their favorite selections, read user reviews, and locate service centers. The interface will be interactive and intuitive, enhancing the overall experience of hypercar enthusiasts.
